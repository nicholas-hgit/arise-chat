<p>Arise chat is a simple command line chat server</p>
<p>It demonstrates socket communication between a client application and a server</p>
<p>Clients who connect to the server can communicate via the terminal in a group chat like environment</p>
<p>This is achieved through message broadcasting to all clients connected to the server</p>
<p>TODO: maintain chat history and maybe user authentication</p>
